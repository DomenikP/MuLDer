The Muli-Level Debugger Framework (MuLDer) enables the development of interactive multi-level debuggers for extensible programming languages that are based on the JetBrains Meta Programming System [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/). Debuggers built with this framework support *language users* in analyzing runtime bugs that they have introduced on the source level, while *language engineers* can debug code on different intermediate levels to analyze bugs that they have introduced through faulty code generators on a proper abstraction level. Further, we provide the Debugger Testing Language (DeTeL), a domain-specific language allowing language engineers to test debugging behavior that they have implemented for an extensible language. The following papers describe DeTeL in further detail and illustrate the idea behind MuLDer also discussing an example multi-level debugger that we have built for [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/) by using MuLDer:
